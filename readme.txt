== Description ==

WooCommerce EU VAT Number lets you collect (and validate) a customers EU VAT number during checkout. EU businesses (outside of the shop base country) with a valid VAT number (non-UK) are not charged VAT. Uses http://isvat.appspot.com/ for VAT number validation.

== Usage ==

Once activated the field will appear on the checkout automatically.

You can configure the message displayed on the checkout by going to WooCommerce > Settings > Tax and editing the 'EU VAT Message' setting.

Customers with a valid VAT number will not pay VAT. The VAT number used will be shown in a custom field on the order page.
